In this IoT application example, the system utilizes several AWS services to manage sensor data processing and state tracking. Lambda functions L1 and L2, implemented in `L1.js` and `L2.js` respectively, handle temperature and pressure readings concurrently. Upon completion, they update their status in the DynamoDB table named "CompletionStatusTable". This table tracks the execution status of each function, ensuring sequential integrity within the system. After both L1 and L2 complete their tasks, they trigger Lambda function L3, coded in `L3.js`, which verifies their completion status in "CompletionStatusTable". If confirmed, L3 proceeds to perform threshold checks for temperature and pressure, updating both a DynamoDB table named "AlertStatusTable" and the IoT device shadow. Furthermore, DynamoDB triggers Lambda function L4, encoded in `L4.js`, upon updates. L4 sends SNS notifications to external clients, providing real-time alerts regarding system state changes. Through orchestrated coordination and efficient data management, the system ensures both parallel processing of sensor data and sequential execution integrity, facilitating timely notifications to external stakeholders.
